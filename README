# WIKIJS

Only you need is launch 

''' docker compose up  '''

Then go to your browser and create your admin user. And that's it!

## Additional configs

Firstly all are in english but you can go to the admin panel and change to your local language.
In there you can change your theme to dark, user management, etc.




### PD:

 I change the port of the wikijs to avoid conflicts with other docker containers, feel free to change this port.
